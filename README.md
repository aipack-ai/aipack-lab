# AIPACK Lab - Project Examples

Here is a list of AIPACK project examples.

Each subfolder is a separate project with its own `.aipack/` folder and is, therefore, an AIPACK workspace.

The recommended approach is to `cd` into the folder and run `aip run ...` from the desired project.

For example:

```sh
cd hello-world
aip run my-agent
```
