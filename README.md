# AIPACK Lab - Project Examples

Here is a list of AIPACK project examples.

Each subfolder is a separate project with its own `.aipack/` folder and is, therefore, an AIPACK workspace.

The recommended approach is to `cd` into the folder and run `aip run ...` from the desired project.

For example:

```sh
cd hello-world
aip run hello-world

```

NOTE: Make sure to have AIPACK Version `aip -V` `=> 0.7.10`

```sh
$ aip -V
aipack 0.7.10
```
